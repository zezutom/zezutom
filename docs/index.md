My name is Tomas. I am a software engineer with a passion for all sorts of automation and cloud computing. 
I am also a keen advocate of open source software and a contributor to several projects. 

I have worked in the IT industry for over 20 years. My experience spans across a number of industries 
including cyber security, finance, telecoms, gaming and public sector.

I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at [Gen](https://www.gendigital.com/) where I am responsible for
the design and development of a cloud-based platform for the management of digital assets.
